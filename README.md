# autobuildc
This is a simple example of automatic build and makefile generation for C/C++ projects.

This project aims to present the GNU development tools for automating software build routines.

Here I am just simulating the creation of a source package for distribution of a possible application to be compiled on the client's machine and my goal is to learn how to use tar, gzip, bzip2 tools for LPIC certification.

Tools used:
===========
autoconf, automake
